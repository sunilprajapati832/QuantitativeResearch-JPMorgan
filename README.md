In every interview, you will likely be asked, “Why do you want to work here?” and “Why this role?” Use these interview tips to craft the perfect answer to these common questions.
“Why are you interested in this role?”
I recently participated in JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Quantitative Research virtual job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to work on a Quantitative Research team at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

I worked on a project that involved forecasting and predictive modeling. I practiced using advanced Python code and built my data analysis and modeling skills in a real-world context.

Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy manipulating large data sets to inform business solutions and I’m excited to apply these skills on the Quantitative Research team at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
